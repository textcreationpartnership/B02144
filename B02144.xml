            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>For the Honourable, my very good FRIENDS, Sir <hi>ROBERT HANSON</hi> Sheriff, and <hi>ALEXANDER HOLT,</hi> Eſquire, Alderman of the City of <hi>LONDON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE common danger of the approaching and ſpreading Peſtilence, (which was ſufficient to awaken every heart) made ſome impreſsions upon me, but eſpecially the number of youth in my Family, did ſtir up a quicker ſence both of danger and duty, to diſcharge the truſt repoſed in me, in caring for their preſervation, as mine own.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:180163:4"/>
            <p>Amongſt all the Remedies I could think of, I found none ſo efficacious to quiet my heart from the fear of evil, as Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reliance upon Divine Providence: And the experience that I have had heretofore, That awakening Judgements do make way for Counſel, hath induced me to make theſe Thoughts pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, hoping that what hath been uſeful to me, may be profitable to others.</p>
            <p>In this endeavour, I could not paſs you by without ſpecial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and reſpect. A great part of the mercy vouchſafed to my Family, being yours, having four Sons preſerved in it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides your Intereſt in the famous City of <hi>LONDON,</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:180163:4"/> whom this is chiefly publiſht, of which you have the Honour, not onely to be Members, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; where, by your reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this time of its <hi>Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> you have had advantages above many, to furniſh your ſelves with inſtances of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards the City, your own and other Families, which have been wonderfully preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Valley of the ſhadow of Death. To which I may add your intereſt in me, by which you may entitle your ſelves to what ever I may be ſerviceable to your ſelves or Families in.</p>
            <p>Now that in the peruſal of this, you may find, that your lives, and the lives of your Relations, were given to you in mercy, and that
<pb facs="tcp:180163:5"/> the City, in the midſt of which you have been preſerved, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, That you have been kept alive to be bleſſings to it, ſhall be the Prayer of</p>

                     <hi>DEUT. 33.29.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Happy art thou, O Iſrael; Who is like unto thee, O people, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Lord.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>MOſes</hi> the Servant of the Lord, having finiſhed his courſe, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and led them through the red Sea, and the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, being not permitted to go into <hi>Canaan,</hi> (though he ſeriouſly begged it of God) receives the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180163:6"/> of Death, with particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to go up into Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> and dye: Though he ſtrugled a little in this, and would fain have gotten a Diſpenſation to go over into <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet perceiving that God had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe determined concerning him, he lets fall his ſuit, and he chearfully ſets himſelf to obey the Command of God, when he had firſt taken care for his Succeſſor, and prayed for, and bleſt his people. In this Chapter we have <hi>Moſes</hi> his farwel; he takes leave of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as Chriſt did of his Diſciples; his laſt words are as full of Love and Conſolation as poſſibly they could be. He deals out a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to every Tribe in particular, and then bleſſes them in the whole lump, and not only them, but all the people of God. And being lifted up in his ſpirit, he hath a far better proſpect than he had of <hi>Canaan</hi> upon Mount <hi>Nebo:</hi> he takes a view of what God had done, and of what he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180163:6"/> to do for them; and he breaks out in conſideration of this, into a ſerious admiration at their happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, in theſe words, <hi>Happy art thou, O Iſrael; Who is like unto thee, Oh people ſaved by the Lord?</hi> In which we have,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Moſes</hi> his judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſtate, <hi>Happy art thou O Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The confirmation of this, in which he notes the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ſingularity of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Who is like to thee?</hi> (i. e.) there is none like to thee: Thy Priviledg and Bleſſing is remarkable, becauſe thou enjoyeſt it alone; none can boaſt of it but thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He explains this his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and ſhews wherein the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> lies, in theſe words, <hi>Saved of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them happy, is, Becauſe God hath ſuch a ſpecial care of them, to<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180163:7"/> keep them and ſave them in all times of trouble and danger.</p>
            <p>The words might be broken into many Propoſitions, but they may be beſt taken in this one Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Gods peculiar Care and Providence toward his people, is their peculiar happineſs.</hi> Or, <hi>It is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the people of God alone, that they are under the ſpecial Care and Providence of God; he hath a p cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar regard to them, they are the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord, for whoſe ſafety he provides above all others; and in compariſon of whom, he cares for none in the world beſides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To make this Propoſition clear, I am to prove,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God hath a people of whom he hath a ſpecial Care.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The people who are the ſubjects of this peculiar Care and Providence, are happy above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:180163:7"/>
            <p>But I know if I prove the former, the latter will be granted; all men agreeing in this, That Preſervation and Safety, in time of private or publick danger, is a great happineſs; and I think all men that have not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up themſelves to groſs <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> will agree, That the beſt Security that a man can have againſt all kind of Evils, is an Intereſt in Divine Providence.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore endeavour to ſhew you, That God hath a peculiar Care of his People in all conditions, to ſave them from the many evils that they are compaſſed about withall; this being the only thing that needs any proof. In proſecution of this, I ſhall ſhew you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some inſtances of this Care and Providence, both in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Church in general, and to particular perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How this is expreſt; what terms the Holy Ghoſt uſes to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180163:8"/> communicate the notions of it to us, that our conceptions of it may be regulated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wherein this Care for the ſafety of God's people, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt; how it appears in its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and is proved by actions as well as words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Some Reaſons for this, That though this be far above what we can rationally expect, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our unworthineſs; yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing built more reaſonably upon Scripture Suppoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The improvement that may be made of this Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then, for the inſtances which may be given of this Truth: We may ſee it in the Care that he takes of his whole Church, when it was confined to the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Care did God take of them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they were near to ruine? <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his people had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180163:8"/> conſulted and determined their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But what ſayes God? <hi>Exo.</hi> 3.7. <hi>I have ſeen their affliction, and heard their cry, and know their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> It is a great evidence of his Care, that he obſerved and weighed their ſufferings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When he begins to work for their deliverance, and ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches out his hand to bring his ſore Judgments upon their Oppreſſors, he does not ſend his Judgments upon the whole Land promiſcuouſly, but he ſeparates betwixt the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When <hi>Pharoah</hi> begins ſo far to yeild, as to admit of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, never did any ſtand ſtricter upon terms, than he; he would abate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his demand; never was the Intereſt of any people better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, or more carefully provided for, than theirs: he would not leave a hoof behind, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.26. he would make no compoſition with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:180163:9"/> 
               <hi>Pharoah,</hi> all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all that was <hi>Iſraels,</hi> muſt be delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When he had brought them thence, and they were come out, according to his demands, what care did he take of their preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the Red Sea, when they were compaſſed in on every ſide, the Sea before, the Mountains on both ſides, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> behind them; yet he led them through the Sea, as on dry Land; and as he left none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo he loſt none here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When they were in the Wilderneſs, what care does he take to lead them in their way, by a Cloud and Pillar of Fire; and to provide for them in that deſolate place, ſo that they had not only bread and water, food and raiment; but, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſayes, They had Angels food.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> View them in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and you ſhall find won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Providence, in their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180163:9"/> from dangers, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of them, when they had brought themſelves in trouble by their provocations</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> God had aſſured them of his Providential Care of them, while they walked in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; nay, he had given them one ſpecial Command, which they could not obſerve without a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon his Providence. He had commanded all the Miles from all parts to appear before him thrice every year. Now this muſt needs be dangerous, and againſt all the Rules of policy, if they had not had a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in Divine Providence: It might ſeem a very inconſiderate thing to go up, and leave all their Countrey naked, their Wives and Children to defend themſelves in the midſt of Enemies, who muſt needs know the times of their going up to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> But God undertook to guard their Countrey in the mean
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:180163:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> time, and he kept the enemy not only from invading, but alſo from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Laſtly, View them in their Captivity, when they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord to give them up into the hands of their Enemies; yet the Lord hath a ſpecial care of them, to preſerve them under the evils which he brought upon them for their ſins; we may ſee this evidently, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.24, 25. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1, 2. <hi>Who gave Jacob to the ſpoil, and Iſrael to the Robbers? Did not the Lord, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom they have ſinned? for they would not walk in his ways, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they obedient to his Law; therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the ſtrength of battel, and it hath ſet him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart. But now, thus ſaith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Iſrael; fear not, for I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:180163:10"/> have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy Name, thou art mine, When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the Rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee: when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ever God would leave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in time of trouble, it would be in ſuch a caſe as this when they were under the trouble which he had brought upon them, and that for their ſin; yea, when they behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very ill under the hand of God which was upon them: <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſo provoked the Lord, that he could not ſpare them; yet in their afflictions he could not forſake them. He would go with them thorow fire and water. VVe have very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſages of Gods Providence to that people in their Captivity, to preſerve them from being cut off; we may read it at large in the Book
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:180163:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> of <hi>Heſter;</hi> when miſchief was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt them, and they were deſigned for ruine, then muſt <hi>Heſter</hi> by a ſtrange Providence be brought to the Crown, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> as ſtrangely and as ſeaſonably prefer'd to Honour. For though be had done the King Service before by diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Plot, which was laid againſt him; yet the King takes no notice of this till ſuch time as the <hi>Jews</hi> were in extream danger to be cut off; and <hi>Haman</hi> muſt be uſed to help to raiſe <hi>Mordecai</hi> to Honour, who had deſigned not only his, but the ruine of all the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the Providence of God cures the Church in general. Will you ſee it towards particular perſons? Conſider it then in theſe few, for inſtances, of many that might be given, without number.</p>
            <p>VVhat proviſion did God make for <hi>Noah,</hi> and the ſafety of him and his Family, becauſe he was righteous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180163:11"/> in that generation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.14. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God directs him to make an Ark that he might eſcape that common deſtruction. After he had made the Ark by Gods direction, God takes care to call him into the ſame when the time was come, that the encreaſe of the waters might not prevent him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1. VVhen he had call'd him in, he is careful to ſhut him in, to ſecure him from the waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.16. God would hereby expreſs the great care that he had of <hi>Noah,</hi> that he would not truſt to his care in making every place faſt where the water might come in to annoy him; he might for want of skill, being not acquainted with ſuch a Veſſel for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, or for want of ſufficient care, not knowing what danger he ſhould be in, nor yet underſtanding the force of the waters, have left open ſome cranny, at leaſt, whereat the water might have broken in upon him. God therefore would ſhut eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:180163:12"/> door himſelf, and by a ſecret power he did alſo fortifie the ſeveral parts of the Ark againſt the force of the waters.</p>
            <p>VVhen God was about to deſtroy <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> by fire, See what care he takes of <hi>Lot,</hi> becauſe he had a righteous Soul that was vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the filthy converſation of the <hi>Sodomites, Gen.</hi> 19. where we ſee, firſt, God ſends his Angels to call him out, and to bring out all that he had in it, <hi>v.</hi> 12. VVhen the danger is eminent, and the time draws nigh to deſtroy the City, they haſten him, <hi>v.</hi> 15. when language will not do it, they pluck him out of his own houſe, and out of the City, and the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, <hi>v.</hi> 16. nay, that he may not periſh out of the City, they grant him a City to flye unto. God ſhut <hi>Noah</hi> into the Ark to keep dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from him, and he pulls <hi>Lot</hi> out, to keep him from the danger.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:180163:12"/>
            <p>Read but the ſtories of <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Elijah</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> in their Pilgrimage, and you cannot but acknowledg a ſpecial providence of God attending them in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. VVhen <hi>Abraham</hi> was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the weakneſs of his faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in it, how does God take care to bring him off with ſafety and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour! He afflicts <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then acquaints him with the reaſon of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.3.</p>
            <p>See his care of <hi>Jacob</hi> when he fled from his Brother <hi>Eſau;</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for him, firſt, in his Uncles houſe; and when the time is come, the ſame Providence which brought him thither, and kept him there, muſt make way for his Return, to bring him off ſafely; for his place of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, was become his Priſon; his Wealth too great a Booty to let go; but God meets <hi>Laban, Gen.</hi> 31.24. before he overtakes <hi>Jacob,</hi> and prevents him from doing the injury he intended.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:180163:13"/>
            <p>After he had eſcaped the hands of <hi>Laban,</hi> he muſt fall into the hands of <hi>Eſau,</hi> who had long ſince threatned his death, and hath now the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that he had looked for to cut him off; yet God turns his heart, and makes him kind to <hi>Jacob;</hi> ſo that he might well ſay, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.4. I have ſeen thy face, as if I had ſeen the face of God; for he might ſee Gods face in his. It was God that made <hi>Eſau</hi> kind to <hi>Jacob;</hi> it was a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled God, that made a reconciled Brother.</p>
            <p>Conſider but the care that God takes of <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he w s diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Famine on the one hand, and the perſecution of <hi>Jezabel</hi> on the other. He feeds him by an Angel, by the Ravens, and by the Widow of <hi>Sareptah.</hi> We muſt needs confeſs him to be a great inſtance of Gods Providence.</p>
            <p>The like we have in <hi>David,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> had appointed to death, how
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:180163:13"/> did he perſecute him, and hunt him like a Partridge on the Mountains; yet God raiſes up ſome to ſave him: One while his Wife deceives her Father, when he would have ſlain him in his bed. Another while <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothan</hi> is of his Council, and gives him intelligence when danger is near him, and he was fain to flye to ſave himſelf, and is cloſely purſued in the Wilderneſs, and in great danger to be taken; he is preſerved by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion made upon the Land by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.26, 27. And <hi>David</hi> made haſt to get away for fea of <hi>Saul,</hi> for <hi>Saul</hi> and his men compaſſed <hi>Daved</hi> and his men round about to take them. But there came a Meſſenger unto <hi>Saul,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Haſt thee, and come, forth Philiſtines have invaded the Land.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Saul</hi> returned from purſuing after <hi>David. Saul</hi> never came out with greater reſolution, with better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than now: He was reſolved
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:180163:14"/> to make a ſearch for him through the whole Land, and to find him where ever he ſhould conceal himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>If he be in the Land,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>I will ſearch him out, thorough out all the thouſands of Iudah.</hi> For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, he had correſpondence with the <hi>Ziphites,</hi> who knew thoſe parts where <hi>David</hi> was, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to ſearch out every lurking place of his; and for ſtrength, he had men enough to incloſe <hi>David</hi> and all his men in the Wilderneſſe. <hi>Saul</hi> in all this confidence, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding diſappointed; God had otherwiſe provided to ſecure <hi>David,</hi> and divert <hi>Saul</hi> by a way that neither thought of. Theſe may ſerve for inſtances of this Truth: A farther proof of it may be,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By conſidering the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions by which this Providence of God is ſet forth in Scripture; and they are ſuch as note a very tender and ſpecial care of them, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:180163:14"/> they are chiefly theſe three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Keeping or covering them under his wings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.11, 12. As an Eagle ſtirreth up her neſt, fluttereth over her young, ſpreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings; ſo the Lord alone did lead them.</p>
            <p>The Providence of God which is ſometimes compared to the Hens gathering of her Chickens under her wings, is here ſet forth by the Eagles care of her young ones, which is the nobleſt, the wiſeſt, and ſtrongeſt of Birds, and for tenderneſs to hers, falls ſhort of none. She doth not onely keep them in the Neſt, but ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them alſo with her from the Neſt, and that, not with her Talons, as ſhe does her prey, leſt ſhe ſhould hurt them; but, on her wings. <hi>David</hi> praying for help in time of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, uſes this expreſſion, Pſal. 17.8, 9. <hi>Hide me under the ſhadow of thy
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:180163:15"/> wings, from the wicked that oppreſs me, from my deadly enemies, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs me about. David</hi> knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, That under this ſhadow he ſhould be ſecret and ſafe from his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, how many or how ſtrong ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: And the ſecurity of ſuch a perſon he does elſewhere ſtrongly aſſert, eſpecially againſt that Evil which no other ſtrength or skill can protect us from, I mean the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peſtilence, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. in ver. 1, 4. he alludes to this expreſſion, and in the following verſes he ſhews the fruit of this, in a freedom both from the fear of the Judgment, and of the Judgment it ſelf. V. 1. <hi>He that dwelleth in the ſecret place of the Moſt High, ſhall abide under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Almighty.</hi> V. 4. <hi>He ſhall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings ſhalt thou truſt.</hi> But what advantage ſhall this be to him? See in the following verſes, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of the terror
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180163:15"/> by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the Peſtilence that walketh in darkneſs, nor for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that waſteth at noon-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though this be not an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſe of freeing every godly perſon from this noiſom diſeaſe, yet it is a ground for their hope; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God may take hold of this promiſe, and plead it with God for their preſervation; and if they be found in their duties, acting faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, there is very much ſpoken in theſe words for their ſecurity; For God hath given his Angels charge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, to keep them in all their ways, eſpecially if we make the Moſt High our Habitation. If we would have the benefit of Divine Protection, we muſt be ſure to put our ſelves under it, by a particular act of Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond expreſſion by which this Providence is expreſt, is his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his people in time of danger,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:180163:16"/> 
               <hi>Pſal</hi> 27.5. <hi>In the time of trouble he ſhall hide me in his pavillion; in the ſecret of his Tabernacle ſhall he hide me:</hi> And Pſal. 31.20. <hi>Thou ſhalt hide me in the ſecret of thy preſence, from the pride of men, thou ſhalt keep them ſecretly in a pavillion from the ſtrife of tongues.</hi> This is another way by which we expreſs the care we take for thoſe we love, when we fear to be overpowered or oppreſt, we hide that which we would keep; where we ſuſpect our ſtrength to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect what we deſire to preſerve, we make up that defect by care and skill. Thus <hi>Rahab</hi> hid the Spyes, whom ſhe could not protect from the fury of the King of <hi>Jericho.</hi> And <hi>Obadiah</hi> had no other way to protect the Prophets from <hi>Jezabel</hi>'s fury, and the raging Famine, but to hide them by fifties in Caves. Now the Lord uſes this way of expreſſing his care for his people, not becauſe there is any defect in him of power
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:180163:16"/> to defend and ſecure them againſt all the force and oppoſition of men, for he can defend them from all their enemies, as he did <hi>Elijah</hi> on the top of the Mountain, from the Captains of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and their fifties. But the Lord uſes this to ſhew us, That his care for his, is no way ſhort of our care for ours; what courſe we take to preſerve any thing dear to us, that doth God take for the ſecurity of his; his Wiſdom as well as his Power, is ſeen in ſaving them in time of danger.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third expreſſion of his Care is, Keeping them as the Apple of the Eye. God's Care of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is expreſt thus, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.10. <hi>He found him in a deſart Land, and in the waſt howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wilderneſs; he led him about, he inſtructed him, he kept him as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his eye.</hi> Now we know that no part of mans body is kept with more care and tenderneſs than the eye, not only becauſe it is of ſo much
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:180163:17"/> uſe, and ſo great an ornament to the body, but alſo becauſe it is ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the leaſt touch and is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that which other parts feel not; therefore ſayes God, Zach. 2.8. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye.</hi> As the Eye, ſo God is not only ſenſible of blows, but of touches; not only great, but ſmall injuries done to the people of God, do affect him; and as men keep out duſt or hairs out of the eye, ſo does the Lord keep off all Evils from his people; therefore ſays he, Pſal. 105.15. <hi>Touch not mine anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and do my Prophets no harm.</hi> Therefore <hi>David</hi> calling upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, beſpeaks it in theſe words, Pſal. 17.8. <hi>Keep me as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the eye.</hi> Lay theſe three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions together, and tell what can be poſſibly added to expreſs the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care and watchfulneſs of Divine Providence over the people of God; He that believes this to be true, can
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180163:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſay nothing leſs than <hi>Moſes</hi> does here, <hi>Who is like to thee, oh Iſrael, a people ſav d by the Lord?</hi> Thus I have ſhewn you how this Divine care is expreſt in Scripture-Language; the next thing is, To ſhew wherein this is expreſt in deed, and matter of fact: Which is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Third Particular; Wherein does God expreſs his Care of his People? His Actions as well as his Word ſpeak it out plain, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He hath a ſpecial Care of them when he ſends his Judgments abroad into the World; and this Care al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes precedes the Judgment; he conſults and provides always for their ſafety, before he ſends his Judgments forth. As we ſee in <hi>Noah,</hi> proviſion is made for his ſafety before the World is drowned; And <hi>Lot</hi> muſt be pluckt out of <hi>Sodom</hi> before it is burnt. And the Mourners in <hi>Jeruſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> muſt be marked, before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:180163:18"/> Angels are ſent out, <hi>Ez.</hi> 9.4, 5.</p>
            <p>And the four Angels muſt not go forth to hurt the Earth, till the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God are ſealed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Now the Care that God takes of his people in time of publick Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, reſpects either their bodies or ſouls.</p>
            <p>His care of their perſons is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to preſerve them from thoſe Evils which are coming upon the World. Thus he kept <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and the Mourners in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the Angels had a charge not to come nigh them. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, If he ſuffer any of thoſe Judgments to reach them, yet he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them under them. Thus when God brought a Famine upon the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he provided bread for <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and when it fell upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time, the Lord provided for <hi>Elijah</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that they were kept alive. And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:180163:18"/> this was one great act of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to keep <hi>Iſrael</hi> alive ſo many years in a Wilderneſs, of which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſpeaking in this Chapter, ſayes, v. 27. <hi>The Eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are everlaſting Arms.</hi> God's Care is as much ſeen in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his people under trouble, as in keeping them from trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God's Care of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under Publick Evils, reſpects their ſouls; and that alſo appears in two particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He hath a great Care of the Comforts of his People; he provides for Theſe, as well as for their Lives and Eternal Eſtates; he would not have their Spirits ſink under any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that befalls them. Therefore it is obſervable, when God was about to ſend Judgments upon the earth, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as may ſeem to reach all, good and bad; he did uſe to give ſome warning before hand, and he firſt denounc't theſe Judgments to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:180163:19"/> awaken the wicked; now leſt the godly ſhould be diſcouraged by theſe, he did uſually interweave thoſe Threatnings with ſome of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Promiſes: For inſtance, read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe few, inſtead of many, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.12, 17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.22. &amp; 16.60. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.10. &amp; 2.14. <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.5-13. In all which God is repreſented very terrible in his Judgments, ſo that it may be ſaid of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>The ears of him that heareth ſuch things, muſt needs tingle.</hi> Yet you ſhall not find ſweeter Promiſes in all the Book of God, than in theſe places where he hath ſo bitterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his Judgments. This muſt needs be in favour of his people, whoſe hearts he would not have made ſad. And it is remarkable, when the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> had made ſuch a terrible deſcription of God in his Power and Wrath, in the firſt ſix verſes, which might make the heart
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:180163:19"/> of a <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſhake, or an <hi>Elijah</hi> to cover himſelf with his Mantle; he adds <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>The Lord is good, a ſtrong hold in the day of trouble, and he knoweth them that truſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is that forementioned of <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> leſs obſervable, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given the like dreadful account of God's coming forth to execute Judgment, in which he ſays, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Before him went the Peſtilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet:</hi> Leſt his people ſhould fear and flye from him alſo, he adds, ver. 13. <hi>Thou wenteſt forth for the ſalvation of thy people;</hi> And becauſe this might ſeem incredible, that God ſhould go forth in ſuch a way as this, to ſave his people, nothing could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but death from ſuch a Providence; he therefore doubles the expreſſion, <hi>Even for ſalvation with thine Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> As if he would beſpeak the comfort of his people in this, What ever you ſee doing in the World, or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:180163:20"/> how terrible ſoever God appears in the way of his Judgments, yet be not you diſcouraged, for he intends no hurt to you in all this, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end; but rather lift up your heads, becauſe the day of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption draws nigh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As he hath a Care of them, to comfort them againſt the coming of a Judgment; ſo when he hath brought it, and it reaches them, he takes care to ſanctifie it to them: Whatever they ſuſtain or ſuffer in their Bodies, Names or Eſtates, it is made up in the communication of the Divine Nature, and the encreaſe of Grace, that is made by theſe things.</p>
            <p>The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us plainly, That the End of God in afflicting his people, is their profit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. But what profit is it that comes by theſe? He tells us, it is the partaking of his Holineſſe. When we are made partakers of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:180163:20"/> Life of God, we are gainers, though we ſhould loſe our own lives in the inqueſt of it. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle counſels the Saints to rejoice in their afflictions, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>My Brethren, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations, knowing this, That the trial of your Faith worketh patience.</hi> Never be ſad for what you ſuffer, for if you get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but patience, you will be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by all your ſufferings. Now Faith and Patience are as much tryed and improved by what we ſuffer from God, as what we ſuffer from men. And though it be hard upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to rejoice under afflictions, yet the people of God do often rejoice after them, for the good they have received by them, as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.71. <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes:</hi> For he had ſaid before, v. 67. <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray; but now have I kept thy word.</hi> Thus
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:180163:21"/> you ſee the Providence of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears towards his people, either in keeping them from the evils which fall upon others, or the ſanctifying them to them, and turning them into good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He hath a ſpecial Care of his people to preſerve them from thoſe Evils which their Enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and deſign againſt them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the Devil or wicked men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God hath ſo great a care of his people, that the Devil (their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary) who goeth about like a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour, yet cannot touch them without leave of God; as we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Job</hi> 1.10. The Devil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that <hi>Job</hi> was ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the Hedg that God had made about him, that there was no touching of him; there was no gap in that Hedg, and it was too high and ſtrong to break over it; God muſt open a door, and let him in, or he could do nothing to <hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:180163:21"/>2. His Providence appears great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in preſerving them in the World, in the midſt of their Enemies, the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and that ſeveral ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſometimes reſtraines their Enemies, and over-rules their Counſels, that they cannot ſpeedily reſolve upon, or effectually execute what they deſign. Thus he withheld <hi>Balaam</hi> from curſing <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained <hi>Laban</hi> from hurting <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, He ſtirs up ſecret friends to favour and to ſhelter his people when danger is near them. Thus he raiſed up <hi>Obadiah</hi> in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Court, to favour the Prophets of the Lord, and to hide and feed them in the perſecution of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and the ſore Famine that was upon the Land.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, He ſomtimes converts their Enemies, and makes uſe of thoſe to build the Church, who had before deſtroyed it: Thus he did by <hi>Paul,</hi> who breathed out threatnings againſt the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:180163:22"/>4thly, He ſometimes changes their minds, though he convert them not; as he dealt by <hi>Eſau,</hi> whom the Lord made kind to his Brother <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> though he continued the ſame man he was.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, God ſome times takes them out of the way, as he did <hi>Herod, Matt.</hi> 1.20. who ſought after Chriſt in his Infancy, to cut him off. Thus the Lord preſerves his people from the evils which might fall on them from men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His Providence is ſeen in keeping them from thoſe evils which they are prone to run themſelves into through ignorance or inadvertency. God preſerves his people from many ſecret and unſeen dangers, which they are not ſenſible of, ſuch as they did not foreſee, and therefore could not prevent. He hath given his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels charge concerning them, to keep them in all their ways, who ſhall bear them in their hands, leſt they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:180163:22"/> ſhould daſh their feet againſt a ſtone, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11, 12. They have a charge from God to watch over his people, and they are faithful and affectionate to preſerve them from thoſe evils which they obſerve not, and are prone to overlook.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God's Providence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears toward his people in this, That when he ſends any Judgment upon the Earth, that is to be executed by an unſeen hand, he will not truſt it in the hands of the Evil Angels, but employs the Good Angels, who are Friends and Guardians to his people, and of the Family with them of the firſt-born. This we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> he ſends the Angels about this Work, who might ſecure <hi>Lot</hi> in the deſtruction of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.1. And when the great Plague was ſent upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which deſtroyed Seventy Thouſand men in three days, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.15. it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted by a good Angel. Doubtleſs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:180163:23"/> the Devil would have been glad of ſuch an Employment, but God would not for his peoples ſakes truſt him with any ſuch power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> God's Care for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is ſo great, that it is without any intermiſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.3, 4. <hi>He will not ſuffer thy foot to be moved; he that keepeth thee will not ſlumber: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, he that keepeth Iſrael, ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlumber nor ſleep.</hi> God's Care of his people is a conſtant, uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Care, it leaves no door open for the vigilant Enemy. <hi>Saul</hi> thought himſelf ſafe when he ſlept amongſt his Captains and Souldiers, who had a ſpecial charge to watch for their Kings Life; but while his numerous Guard were all aſleep, <hi>David</hi> went out into his camp, and took away <hi>Sauls</hi> Spear, which was at his Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and with it might have taken away his Life, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.12.</p>
            <p>But God's Providence for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple neither ſleeps nor ſlumbers;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:180163:23"/> therefore their Enemies can take no ſuch advantage of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> So great is the Lord's Care for his People, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in the world was the great thing which lay upon the heart of Chriſt when he was going out of the world. And we all know, that mens affections are then diſcovered; thoſe whom we love, we provide for then. <hi>John</hi> 17.9. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them that thou haſt given me out of the world.</hi> ver. 15. <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldſt keep them from the evil.</hi> The whole Chapter is full of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of his wonderful Love and tender Care for his People, which he uttered at that time, as he himſelf tells them, that they might have his Joy fulfilled in themſelves, that all the people of God might know how his heart in Heaven, is affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them on Earth. Thus you ſee
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:180163:24"/> wherein God expreſſes his Care of his people; next follow the Reaſons that may be aſſigned for this, and they are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. They are his Children; they ſtand in ſuch a Relation to him, as engages him to be careful of them. They are born unto him by Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now we cannot think that the God of Nature, who hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed this upon every Creature, to take care of its own, will himſelf be found wanting in this.</p>
            <p>The tenderneſs and care of men and beaſts to their little ones, is all derived from him; and will not then his Love and Care much more exceed theirs? He tells us himſelf, that the Mother may forget the Son of her Womb, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on him; but the Lord will not forget his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. They are his Jewels, of the greateſt price to him, his peculiar Treaſure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. He ſets a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:180163:24"/> price upon them, than he does upon all the world beſide. This he confirms by actions, and renders as the reaſon of ſome remarkable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.14. <hi>He ſuffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved Kings for their ſakes.</hi> He values their Ranſome at a higher rate, for he gives whole Countries and Kingdoms for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.3. <hi>I gave Egypt for thy ranſome, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.</hi> This is a ſufficient proof of the high eſteem that God hath of them; and things which we highly prize, we tenderly care for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. They are his Portion, his Inheritance, all that he hath ſet apart for himſelf in the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. <hi>The Lord hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelf,</hi> Deut. 32.9. <hi>The Lords portion is his people; Jacob is the Lot of his Inheritance.</hi> Theſe are mighty expreſſions, enough to aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us, That God who is Lord of of all the World, who hath Heaven
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:180163:25"/> and Earth, and all that is therein, ſhould, as it were, quit his Intereſt in all the reſt, and count it inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and little worth, in compariſon of a few that he hath choſen out of it, who were as bad as the reſt, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in what they are beholding to him for, and are made better by his choice.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. His Honor depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe, they are the only people that lay his Concernments to heart, and take care of his glory; others do ſerve, and help forward his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in the world, but they do it not out of deſign, they mind only their own things; but his people deſign to ſerve and honor him, and mind his glory as their greateſt intereſt in the world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>As always, ſo now alſo, Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or death; for to me to live is Chriſt, and to dye is gain.</hi> The glory of Chriſt is that which a Chriſtian aims at in life and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:180163:25"/> death; yea, he makes every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar action ſubſervient to this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> Now it is no wonder if God take care for thoſe who take care for him; if they deſign his glory, much more does he their preſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Becauſe he hath dearly purchaſed them, he hath bought them at a dear rate, he hath bought them at firſt with a great price, not of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold, but with the precious blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this, he oftentimes makes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential purchaſe of them, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men and people for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43, 3. Now we know, that the things which we purchaſe dearly, we lay up ſafely, and keep them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, becauſe we will not loſe the coſt and charge we have been at. Thus God reaſons from former mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to future preſervations, <hi>Iſa</hi> 43.4. <hi>Since thou haſt been precious in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:180163:26"/> my ſight, thou haſt been honourable, and I have loved thee; therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. He is careful of them, becauſe they love him; theſe are the people of all the world, that love God; therefore they are the people that he minds above all the world; he hath their hearts, and therefore they have his. Pſal. 91.14. When God had ſpoken of his care of his people, and their ſafety from the Peſtilence, he adds this as the Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. The Reaſon of all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is, He hath ſet his love upon them, Pſal. 146.8. <hi>The Lord loveth the righteous.</hi> John 16.27. <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf loveth you.</hi> Nay, ſo great is the Love of God to his people, that he is called Love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.16. Now thoſe whom we love, we take care of; we conſider
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:180163:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> not ſo much their merit or demerit, if they be in danger; but we feel in our ſelves what they ſuffer; and we can no more forbear to prevent an evil that we ſee coming upon them, or labour to remove it when it is come, than we can forbear to ſeek out for help for our ſelves, if we were in the ſame caſe. God's Love makes him ſympathize with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all their ſufferings, therefore he ſayes by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9. <hi>In all their afflictions I was afflicted with them;</hi> wonder not then at what follows, <hi>the Angel of his preſence ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the dayes of old.</hi> Where Love is ſo powerful to cauſe ſuch a ſenſe of affliction, it muſt needs awaken our care, and ſtir up all our circumſpection to prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the evil which fall upon us, in falling upon thoſe we love.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:180163:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to make this Truth clear; yet before I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, I muſt remove ſome obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions out of the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. <hi>How does the Care of God appear for his people, ſeeing we find that they have often been made a prey to the wicked, and the Scripture gives an account of hard things that they have ſuffered under them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Scripture which gives us account of their ſufferings, tells us alſo of their preſervation under thoſe troubles, ſo that rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they do not darken, but clear the Providence of God. How did God preſerve <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 3.2. though the buſh burned with fire, it was not conſumed? And as the Apoſtle ſays concerning himſelf and the Primitive Chriſtians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. Though they were perſecuted, yet they were not forſaken.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:180163:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. God's Care of his people ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, That he encreaſed them by their Troubles, as well as preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them under them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.12. the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew; and it hath been the experience of the Chriſtian Church, <hi>That the blood of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs hath been the Seed of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. His Care appears greatly in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for their ſouls; he ſanctifies theſe troubles to them, and does them a great deal of good in the trying and ſtrengthening of their Graces, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The tryal of your Faith being much more precious than Gold,</hi> Rom. 5.3, 4, 5. <hi>We glory in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, knowing that tribulation work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth patience, and patience experience, and experience hope.</hi> Nay, he does not only do them good at preſent, but makes way for glory, 2 Cor. 4.17. <hi>Our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:180163:28"/>4. Though he hath often given them up into the hands of wicked men, that they might ſhew their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and hatred againſt them; yet he never gave them up to the wills of ſuch; he hath not left wicked men at their own liberty, to do as they pleaſed; but God hath reſerved to himſelf the ordering and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their troubles, to their ſtrength; he hath appointed what they ſhall ſuffer, for number, how many blows they ſhall bear; for weight, how heavy they ſhall be; and for time, how long they ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God hath always had ſuch a Care of them, that they have never periſhed under their afflictions. Though they have fallen, yet they have not periſhed. They have laid down their lives, but they have not loſt them: Their lives have not been taken away, but upon ſuch terms as they have been willing to part with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:180163:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> them, and in which they are gainers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21. He that could ſay, <hi>To him to live was Chriſt,</hi> could alſo ſay, <hi>to dye is gain;</hi> therefore he comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in this, That though he might lay down his life in thoſe troubles which he underwent at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet he ſhould have a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able value for it, for Chriſt ſhould be manifeſted in his body, whether it were by life or death.</p>
            <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Scripture and Experience both tell us, That all things fall alike to all,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.2, 3. <hi>ſo that love or hatred is not to be known by any thing before us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This muſt be underſtood of outward things only thus far, That wicked men have their ſhares in the good things of this life; and good men have their part in the evil things of it: There is no outward good, but the wicked have enjoy'd; nor
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:180163:29"/> no outward trouble and affliction but hath befallen the righteous; and as they have their ſhares of theſe, ſo they have but a ſhare of them; the good have not all the evil, nor the wicked all the good of this world; and there is reaſon for this, becauſe the wicked have their good things here, and the good have their evil things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though all things do fall alike to all, yet all things do not work alike to all. God's care is ſeen in ordering thoſe things which befall his people for their good, in making thoſe things good in the concluſion, which are evil in themſelves; whereas thoſe things which are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or at leaſt reputed ſo among men, are for the hurt of thoſe who enjoy them, when they fall into the hands of wicked men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Upon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares.</hi> There is nothing that ſuch a one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, but it is a ſnare to him, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:180163:29"/> and hold him faſt till God caſt him into Hell; whereas the ſame things are helps to a good man to bring him to Heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things work together for good to thoſe that love God.</hi> So that although Good and Evil be diſpenſed promiſcuouſly among good and bad, and they ſeem to fare all alike; yet does God under theſe carry on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and different works of Mercy and Judgment; of Mercy to the good for their Salvation; and of Judgment to the wicked for their hardning: So that herein is ſeen the Providence of God towards his people, that he furthers their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by thoſe things which are an occaſion of hardening others; and by thoſe Providences which are common to them and others, he carries on a ſpecial deſign of Grace and Mercy to them. So that there is a vaſt difference betwixt thoſe things which ſeem to be the ſame. For
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:180163:30"/> though the godly have all the troubles in the World which any other do meet withall, yet they have not the Wrath and Diſpleaſure of God in them, but a ſecret aſſiſtance and ſupport under them; and though the wicked have all the outward bleſſings that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon his own, yet they have not the Love of God in and through them, and his Bleſſing with them, as the godly have.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though outward things are not ſufficient to diſcover Love or Hatred, they alone are not proofs of one or other; yet it is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably true, That the Love and Hatred of God do run thorough theſe things alſo: God orders and diſpoſes outward things in his love to the Godly; and though ſenſe cannot diſcern his Love by theſe, yet Faith can often ſee it thorow them; and the outward Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God ſpeak his diſpleaſure to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:180163:30"/> the wicked; yea, he often times gives them thoſe things in wrath, in which they bleſſed themſelves; and when they have both finiſhed their races, and they ſhall both look back upon their lives from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, they will both agree in this, That they were in nothing more unlike, than in that in which they ſeemed to be alike.</p>
            <p>Obj. 3. <hi>But we ſee that not only the godly do partake of the ſame Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which befall the wicked, but the wicked alſo do ſhare in the ſame mercies and preſervations with the righteous; they alſo are preſerved in time of danger with the other, no judgement, but takes away as good as it leaves behind it; and leaves as bad as it takes away; where then is ſeen God's care of his people?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is a great difference betwixt the Judgments and Mercies
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:180163:31"/> of the good and bad, though they ſeem to be the ſame, and to ſence without difference.</p>
            <p>For the Mercies of the godly are indeed ſent in Mercy to his people; he orders one Mercy towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a temporal Mercy towards a ſpiritual one, and one Mercy is a pledg of another; ſo that a good man can ſay often times by Faith, as <hi>Leah</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.11. <hi>Behold a troop cometh.</hi> And as <hi>David</hi> reaſoned from his deliverance from the Lyon and the Bear, to his deliverance from the <hi>Philiſtins;</hi> ſo can a good man reaſon from one Mercy of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind to another; but if God give any thing to a wicked man that ſeems a Mercy, it is but to prevent a greater Mercy, a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral to prevent a Spiritual; he gives them temporal Rewards here for any ſervice they do him, to take off their claim to any hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:180163:31"/>
            <p>Again, if he ſend any Judgment upon his people, it is not to deſtroy, but to prevent deſtruction; he ſends temporal judgments to prevent ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; he afflicts them here, that they might not periſh with the World; but to the wicked he ſends one judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make way for another; thus all the Judgments which fell on the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in their own Land, made way for their overthrow at the Red Sea: For this muſt be obſerved, That though publike Judgments do ſpare bad as well as good, and both ſeem to be alike wonderfully delivered from it; yet it is with a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, One is a preſervation from the Evil, and the other a reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſome greater Evil. We read, That the Mourners in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were marked, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9 4. that they might be preſerved from the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which God was bringing upon the City. We find alſo, that <hi>Cain</hi> was marked, that he might not be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:180163:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſlain, the firſt was doubtleſs in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but moſt Interpreters agree in this, That <hi>Cain</hi>'s was a Judgment upon him, a trembling of his heart and head, which imply'd his guilt, and was a terror to others, as well as to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Here then may ariſe a great and weighty Queſtion worthy of the ſerious conſideration of thoſe whom the late Judgment of Peſtilence hath ſpared.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhall I know whether my preſervation from this Judgment be a ſpecial Mercy, or a fruit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Providence? Or whether it be not worſe, a reſervation unto evil?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> You ſhall know three ways. Firſt, By ſome things which go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a preſervation. Secondly, By ſome things which accompany it. Thirdly, By ſome things which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:180163:32"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some things go before ſuch Deliverances as theſe, when they are in Mercy; and they are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A ſenſe of the danger that we are in, that ſo we may be taken off from all ſelf-confidence, and fitted for the obſerving and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Divine Goodneſs: Thus it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>We had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God which raiſeth the dead.</hi> He was as a dead man in his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and was taken off from all hopes and dependencies upon creatures, and had nothing to hold by, but this, <hi>That God was able to raiſe the dead:</hi> This ſenſe of danger uſhered in a great deliverance, and made way for the magnifying of the Mercy of God; and indeed when God intends to bleſs and ſanctifie any deliverance to a man, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares him by the ſenſe of his danger,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:180163:33"/> for a thankful reception of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As there is commonly a ſenſe of the danger, ſo there is alſo of our own unworthineſs of that mercy which we deſire, and of that which we enjoy already, and of our ill deſerving in reſpect of the evil that we fear. Thus it was with <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> when he was in danger of falling into his Brothers hands, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10, 11. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; for with my ſtaff I paſſed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my Brother.</hi> A ſenſe of our unworthineſs of what we have already received of the Lord, is a great argument that God intends us more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Spirit of Prayer; to be earneſt, and ſtrive with God for the mercy. God ſeldom gives any
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:180163:33"/> thing to his people in mercy, but he ſends a Spirit of Prayer to uſher it in. When God would deliver <hi>Jacob</hi> from the hands of <hi>Eſau,</hi> he pours out a mighty Spirit of Prayer, and he wreſtled with God all the night, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. Now what was his wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> expounds it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. <hi>He had power over the Angel, and prevailed; he wept and made ſupplication to him.</hi> And what did <hi>Jacob</hi> pray for this night? he told us before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.11. <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my Brother, from the hand of Eſau, for I fear him, leſt he will come and ſmite me, and the Mother with the Children. Jacob</hi> ſaw that his whole Family lay at ſtake now, there was but a ſtep betwixt them and death; therefore he beſtirs himſelf, and will not give over till he gets the victory, and prevail with God; he will not leave praying till he carry away a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that his prayers are anſwered.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:180163:34"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> An humble Spirit, to ſubmit to the hand of God under that affliction and danger which we pray to be delivered from. It is no contradiction to pray againſt an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and yet ſubmit to the will of God. A man may pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the evil, and yet ſubmit to the will of God; and this is very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, it is a fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of deliverance from trouble al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, and may well be a ſign of preſervation from danger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.41, 42. <hi>If their uncircumciſed hearts ſhall be humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and they then accept of the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of their iniquity, then will I remember my Covenant with Iſrael.</hi> This frame of Spirit was found in <hi>David,</hi> when that heavy affliction befel him, that his own Son rebelled againſt him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11, 12. <hi>Let him alone, and let him curſe, for the Lord hath bidden him. David</hi> ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under God's hand in this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:180163:34"/> and this was an argument that God would deliver him out of that trouble, as we ſee he did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Mourning for thoſe evils which we ſee God is about to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. When God finds us mourning for our own and other mens ſins, whether he ſpare us or take us away in the judgment that is coming, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in mercy. If he ſpare us, it is to ſee better days, and to enjoy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things; if he take us away, it is from the evil that is to come; but commonly God hath a care of ſuch to preſerve them from the evil, as we ſee he did the Mourners in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> when a general judgment was come upon the City, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Now it is our work to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hearts, and conſider, how we have found them under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of this judgment of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence approaching; if we have found ſuch impreſſions as theſe, we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:180163:35"/> may conclude that our lives have been given us in mercy, and that they are the fruits of Gods ſpecial providence and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You ſhall know by ſome things which did accompany this preſervation. While this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from which you are preſerved did hang over your heads, you had ſome ſuch impreſſions as theſe upon your ſpirits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A reſolution to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, in the mid'ſt of trouble, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the calamity be over-paſt. When God intends to give in a mercy of this kind, he commonly draws forth Faith to act for it, at leaſt a Faith of dependance, though not a Faith of aſſurance; and though there may be many fears, yet theſe may ſerve to quicken and ſtir up Faith of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to depend upon God.</p>
            <p>This is the meaning of entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy chambers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.20. Which doth not deny a prudent
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:180163:35"/> uſe of means to prevent evil and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but imply a truſting more to God to preſerve us, then to the means we uſe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Truſt to the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not to thine own underſtanding; in all thy ways acknowledg him, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi> A man is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to uſe his own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but to lean to it. There may be not only a care to prevent danger, but a fear of it; when we have uſed means, and yet a dependance upon God, a caſting of our ſelves upon him for help, with a reſolution to rely upon him, and particularly in this caſe of the Peſtilence, preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is promiſed only upon condition of a Faith of reliance and dependance upon God. As we may ſee in the connexion of the 1, 2, 3 verſes, of the 91. <hi>Pſal. He that dwelleth in the ſecret place of the moſt high, ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide under the ſhaddow of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> What is the meaning of this, but

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:180163:36"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:180163:37"/> that he that makes God his refuge in danger, ſhall be ſafe under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; from this general propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>David</hi> takes up a particular reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to depend upon God, <hi>I will ſay of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortreſs, my God, in him will I truſt.</hi> And from thence he infers for his own, the comfort of all that do thus. <hi>Surely he ſhall deliver thee from the ſnare of the fowler, and from the noiſome Peſtilence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The connexion of the 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. verſes of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> are no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than theſe. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt made the Lord, which is my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, even the moſt high, thy habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there ſhall no evil befall thee, neither ſhall the Plague come nigh thy dwelling.</hi> Where ſuch a particular act of Faith goes before, preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the evil commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; and this is always the fruit of ſpecial grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Where preſervation is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:180163:37"/> in mercy, there is found an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of life, and liberty, and peace; and what ever we enjoy in this as from the hand of God, taking all from him. Faith is a Grace that fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches all from God, and gives all to him; it hath to do with God in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and looks over, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond every creature and means, to him; if Faith apprehend a danger, it takes its preſervation from it, as well as its deliverance out of it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually from God. This we ſee in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18.2. <hi>The Lord is my rock, and my fortreſs, and my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, my God, my ſtrength, in whom I will truſt, my buckler, and the horn of my Salvation, and my high tower. David</hi> gives God all thoſe titles which we give to thoſe things from whence we expect or receive help; whatever men fly too, or depend upon in time of danger, that is God unto <hi>David;</hi> therefore he aſcribes all the deliverance that he had from
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:180163:38"/> trouble, to the Lord alone; he takes his life as given him by the Lord, ver. 16.17. <hi>He ſent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters, he delivered me from my ſtrong ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> And as he acknowledges his preſervation from danger, ſo he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo confeſſes all the good that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys to be peculiarly from the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Thou prepareſt a table for me in the preſence of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: thou anointeſt my head with oil, my cup runneth over:</hi> Thus where God gives any thing in mercy, he gives a heart to acknowledg the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be from him, and to eye God particularly in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A high eſteem of the mercy that comes in ſuch a way. The ſeaſon and the conveyance of the mercy, do much advance the price of it. To live in dying times, to be ſafe when others are in danger, to be in peace when others are in trouble, is a mercy to be highly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:180163:38"/>
            <p>To have all theſe at ſuch a time, is much; but to have them in anſwer to prayer, to have them through the Promiſe and Covenant of Grace, is a great deal more. To have theſe, not as the fruit of common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but of ſpecial grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care' ſets a great luſtre upon the mercy, and makes it very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the eſteem of the ſoul. We ſee <hi>David</hi> was much affected with deliverance that the Lord gave him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. <hi>Becauſe it was in a time of great trouble and danger.</hi> v. 3. <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſſed me.</hi> And becauſe he ſaw the hand of God emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in it, v. 6. <hi>The Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the ſimple, I was brought low and he helped me.</hi> He prized it the more becauſe it came as an anſwer to his prayers. v. 1. <hi>I love the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath heard my voice and my ſupplications.</hi> And cheifly, becauſe through all this, he ſaw that God had a ſingular care of him, and a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:180163:39"/> high eſteem of his life; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his, but of all thoſe that fear him, ver. 15. <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Then preſervation from danger comes in ſpecial mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to us, when the ſame impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are found upon our ſpirits, which the affliction ſanctified ſhould have wrought upon us. When the keeping off of an Evil, doth work the ſame things, that this ſhould have produced, if it had come, and had been ſanctified to the ſoul, then the preſervation from this, is in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the ſoul. As for example, Art thou in health, when others are ſick? Art thou free, when others are ſhut up? Haſt thou life and ſtrength, when others are upon beds of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing? Then enquire, Doſt thou find thoſe workings of thy heart as are ſuitable to a gracious ſpirit upon a ſick bed? Doſt thou ſee the vanity
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:180163:39"/> of the World, the ſhortneſs of time? Doſt thou mourn for the loſs of time, as they do who are going into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? And art thou careful to call thy Evidences together? Doſt thou ſee the preciouſneſs of thy ſoul, the weight of Eternity, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chriſt, and of an Intereſt in God, as if thou wert upon a Death-bed? Oh then thy preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a mercy to thee; for theſe ſhould have been the gracious fruits of ſuch a condition, if thou hadſt been brought into it; for God hath done that good by keeping off the affliction, which he ſhould have done thee by it, if it had fallen upon thee, and had been bleſt unto thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Then Preſervation is in love, when it is accompanied with a ſingular love to God. Thou wilt find thy heart not only in love with God, but thou wilt call upon thy heart more and more to love God. This was <hi>David's</hi> care, to engage his heart
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:180163:40"/> to God, becauſe of that ſingular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of his over him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.1. He is alſo much affected with the goodneſs of God towards his people, he therefore ſtirs up others to love him in reſpect of his Providence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.19, 20,, 23. <hi>Oh how great is thy goodneſs which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee, which thou haſt wrought for them that truſt in thee, before the ſons of men. Thou ſhalt hide them in the ſecret of thy preſence, from the pride of men; thou ſhalt keep them ſecretly in a pavilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the ſtrife of tongues.</hi> Hence he takes occaſion, ver. 23. to call upon men to love God: <hi>O love the Lord, all ye Saints, for the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</hi> It is but reaſonable that when we ſee more of God's love in any Providence, it ſhould engage us to put in more of our love into every duty. We ſhould be full of affection and zeal for the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:180163:40"/> glory of that God, who we ſee cares for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhall know whether this Preſervation be in mercy, by thoſe things which follow it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If there be found in us a care to keep thoſe impreſſions alive which were made upon our hearts in the time of danger and trouble, and our preſervation under it. Many men have ſome ſence of the Mercy and Goodneſs of God in time of great danger, and ſeem to be affected with their deliverance; but theſe are only made by ſome extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, theſe things do not abide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſpirits; whereas a good man labours to keep all the impreſſions that are made upon his heart, either under affliction, or by any Mercy, freſh and lively, that ſo the frame of his heart may be bettered, and that he may get a ſound and good conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of ſoul.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:180163:41"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There will be found in us a great care to live up to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of ſuch a condition, as we ſee it was in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 116.8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17. <hi>Thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.</hi> What follows the ſenſe of this Mercy? ſee in the following verſes: <hi>I will walk before the Lord in the Land of the living. What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits towards me? I will take the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all his people. I will offer to thee the ſacrifice of Thanksgiving, and will call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> Thus we ſee <hi>David's</hi> mercies had an influence upon his whole life, as his outward condition is better'd ſo his whole life is better'd, made more holy, and conform to the will of God. He conſidered not only
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:180163:41"/> what engagements God had laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by his deliverance; but alſo what engagements he had upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: For there are duties which ſpring out of the Mercies which we have received, and there are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which ariſe out of the promiſes which we have made to God, upon condition of deliverance; and a good man conſiders both theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> had an eye to the former, when he ſaid, <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> And he had reſpect to the latter, when he ſayes, <hi>I will pay my vows unto the Lord:</hi> And God expects it at our hands, that we ſhould call to mind the Promiſes that we make in time of trouble; snd the beſt of God's People have need to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them; for we are apter to make them, than to keep them: We may ſee this in <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was ready to make a vow in his affliction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20, 21, 22. <hi>And Jacob vowed a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:180163:42"/> vow, ſaying, If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, ſo that I come again to my fathers houſe in peace, then ſhall the Lord be my God; and this ſtone which I have ſet for a pillar, ſhall be Gods houſe.</hi> But when God had given him not only food and raiment, but had multiplied him greatly, he muſt be called upon to make good this vow, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.1. <hi>And God ſaid to Jacob, Ariſe, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou fleddeſt from the face of Eſau thy Brother.</hi> We ſhould learn of the Mariners in <hi>Jonah,</hi> who made vows after they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; Many will make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and forget them afterward; but a good man either makes them after deliverance, or makes good thoſe that he made before. It is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:180163:42"/> good to take up our vows when our troubles are ceaſed, and to turn them into Reſolutions, to confirm and ſtrengthen them, as our Mercies are perfected. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.6. From the experience that <hi>David</hi> had of the Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, he takes up a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to follow God as long as he lived; he determines to ſtick cloſe to God in his proſperity, who ſtuck to him in his affliction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There will be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after work and ſervice for God, how he may be ſerviceable in his generation. He is not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with general ſervice neither, but is ready to enquire, Whether God hath any particular ſervice for him to do in the World, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he hath preſerved him. God had a peculiar Work to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy <hi>Moſes</hi> in; therefore he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully preſerved him in that time of common Calamity, and brought
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:180163:43"/> him up in <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Court. And when a man that underſtands God's wayes and ends, meets with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular preſervations, he is ready to ask, What hath God to do for me in the World, that he thus preſerves me, when many others are taken away? and he labours to find out that Work, if there be any ſuch.</p>
            <p>This is certain, that God doth nothing in vain; he ſtill propoſeth an end to himſelf, and his ends are the promoting his own glory and intereſt in the World: And doubtleſs his peculiar Works have peculiar Ends: And commonly, what God chiefly intends, that he ſets upon our hearts to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to comply with when it is offered unto us; as we ſee in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> God had preſerved him for the deliverance of his people out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:</hi> And ſee how it was upon his heart before ever the Lord appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:180163:43"/> to him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.12. Nothing doth more beſpeak our lives to be given us in Mercy, than when we value our Lives by our Work; when we can ſay with <hi>Paul, To me to live is Chriſt.</hi> I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth a living for, but Chriſt; I am reſolved while I live, to labour for him, and to apply my ſelf to that peculiar Work to which he hath appointed me, and for which he hath ſo often preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A holy confidence in God for time to come; a dependance on him, and reſolution to truſt in him in all the ſtraits that we ſhall meet withall. Faith grows ſtronger by all the anſwers and rerurns of prayer: If God give in any thing as a mercy, by ſpecial preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it fortifies the ſoul againſt doubts and difficulties for time to come, and a man is able then to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from experience, as <hi>Paul</hi> does,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:180163:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>We had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we might not truſt in our ſelves, but in God which raiſeth the dead, who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver, in whom we truſt that he will deliver.</hi> By theſe and ſuch like Experiences you ſhall be aſſured that your preſervations are the fruit of Divine Love, and that there was more then a common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in your ſafety. You are the ſaved of the Lord, and happy upon this account. But if the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thy heart have been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to theſe, ſuſpend thy joy, thou haſt leſs cauſe than thou art aware of, to rejoice in thy preſervation from this waſting Judgment. It may be but a reſervation for ſome greater evil. But you will ſay, Can there be a worſe Evil than this? I tell thee, Yes; Perhaps God may reſerve thee for ſome judgment that may take thee away when
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:180163:44"/> thou art leſs aware of it; Nay, if God only ſuffer thee to live and to be vile and prophane after ſuch a deliverance, to abuſe his patience and long ſuffering, and fill up the meaſure of thy ſins: This will be a greater judgment then the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which thou haſt eſcaped. The Apoſtle ſpeaks to ſuch an one as thou art, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs and forbearance, and long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, not knowing that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God leadeth thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Mark what is the iſſue of ſuch a frame as this is. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>But after thine hard and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> It had been better for thee that thou hadſt been taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and ſent to hell long ago, then thou ſhouldſt live to treaſure up more wrath, againſt that day of wrath, and to make thy eternal condition ſo much the more intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:180163:45"/> Let me therefore perſwade thee to look back again and again, how it hath been with thee under this dreadful viſitation; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy ſelf, how hath it left thee? Did it find thee ſtupid and inſenſible of danger as many have been? or timerous? if ſo, Whether did thy fears drive thee only to the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, to their directions for thy ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not unto God? And now the danger is ſomething blown o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, thou art left as vain, as unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yea as prophane as before; thou ſayſt in effect as they did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.10. <hi>We are delivered to do all theſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</hi> If this be thy caſe, thou art amiſerable man or woman; thou art none of thoſe whom <hi>Moſes</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in this place, whom he admires as a happy people. And if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt this to be a truth, ſtir up thy ſelf to ſeek after an intereſt in this divine providence: Labour for a life ſuitable to a ſaved one, then
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:180163:45"/> ſhalt thou indeed have cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in thy deliverance; for the good of providence is not ſeen by the viſible effects of it, but is legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the hearts and lives of the ſaved.</p>
            <p>The Uſe that you ſhould make of this truth, all you that are under theſe gracious impreſſions of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or ſincerely labouring after them, ſhould be,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Look upon your mercies as they are, be ſure to acknowledg God in all that you have, and enjoy; give him the glory of his goodneſs and truth, take your lives out of his hand, and ſay, it is the Lord that hath ſaved me alive this day; <hi>Set up your Eben-Ezer, hitherto the Lord hath helped me:</hi> Call nothing common that you have, though your lives and preſervations may ſeem common mercies, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been preſerved as well as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:180163:46"/> you; yet, if you conſider what hath been ſaid, you will find cauſe to account your lives ſingular and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial mercies, becauſe there is more in them than there is in others; you have been preſerved by a gracious providence; whereas others have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped by a general providence; you have been ſaved in mercy; whereas others have been reſerved in judgment. Nothing will conduce more to the quickning of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and to raiſe them up to live like your ſelves, than a true eſtimate of your mercies; for this will make you ſenſible of your engagements; and theſe conſidered, will quicken you to your duties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Love God.</hi> There is nothing more natural than this, that we ſhall love thoſe who love us, and take the moſt care of us in our greateſt dangers. This is that which <hi>David</hi> urges upon all the people of God, not onely to love him every
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:180163:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> one for the care that God hath of him, but every one to love him for the care that he hath of all the faithful. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.23. <hi>Oh love ye the Lord, all ye his Saints, for the Lord preſerveth the faithful.</hi> And let it ſeem but a reaſonable thing to you, to grant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> God a peculiar intereſt in your hearts and lives, who have a ſpecial intereſt in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Be careful to pay your vows that you have made to the Lord in the time of danger. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as well the duties which ſpring out of your promiſes made to God, as thoſe which ariſe out of his providence towards you, and make conſcience of both. Time was, when you valued your lives and the lives of your relations at a great rate; you offered freely and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for your ſelves and them when trouble was near; O do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value them now; think that enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:180163:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> of them now, to be as much worth as ever you did eſteem them; Seeing God has taken you at your word, and has given you what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, be ſure you make your word good, and give him what you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, Be of good courage, ſtrengthen your ſelves in God, from the experience that you have had of his goodneſs and truth; and live in a conſtant dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and hope in him for the time to come; that will be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that you believe this truth; and it will be an honouring of Gods providence.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more rationally deduced from this truth, than a comfortable reliance upon God; It is the inference of the Holy Ghoſt from the Premiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.24. When he had aſſerted the Providence of God over his people, in theſe Words <hi>(The Lord
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:180163:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> preſerveth the Faithful)</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts or infers this, <hi>Be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen your hearts, all ye that hope in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſt of all,</hi> This truth ſpeaks to every man after this manner. You ſee nothing can make a man happy which cannot render him ſafe, a great part of our happineſs in this life lying in a freedom from evil, rather than in the enjoyment of good, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the happineſs of the life to come. And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much contributes to our ſafety, as an intereſt in Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: Can riches, honours, art, intereſt in men, ſay thus to thee, and make it good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.5.6. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be afraid of the terrour by night, nor for the arrow that flyeth by day, nor for the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence that walketh in darkneſs, nor for the deſtruction that walketh at noon-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:180163:48"/>
            <p>But God can ſpeak thus to thy ſoul, and cauſe thee to walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear in the valley of the ſhaddow of death.</p>
            <p>Make haſt then, and intereſt thy ſelf in God, and improve this by Faith and prayer; it is the beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative thou canſt provide for thy ſelf and Family. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.10. <hi>The name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, the righteous runneth into it, and is</hi> Safe. Nay here is ſhelter for <hi>Thine</hi> as well as <hi>Thee.</hi> Prov. 14 26. <hi>In the fear of the Lord is ſtrong confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and his</hi> Children <hi>ſhall have a place of</hi> Refuge. Would'ſt thou be good to thy ſelf and to thy Family, make God thine, <hi>That thou mayeſt dwell in the ſecret of the Lord and abide under the ſhaddow of the Almighty.</hi> And time and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will confirm thee in this truth, that they are ſafe whom God keeps, and happy whom he ſaves;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:180163:48"/> and with <hi>David</hi> thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. verſe 15. <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that people that is in ſuch a caſe; Yea happy is that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
